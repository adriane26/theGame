# theGame
My first project for WDI General Assembly Seattle.

This is a 2-player memory game featuring some of the characters from the world of tokidoki.
I used Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap and sweetAlerts to create and style my game. 

I hope you have fun playing, because I had fun making it! Enjoy! [adriane26.github.io/theGame/](http://adriane26.github.io/theGame/)

*future versions will include difficulty levels featuring different characters.
